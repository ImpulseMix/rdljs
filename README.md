# rdljs

A lightweight javascript library for Microsoft RDL/RDLC reporting rendering

This is a work in progress project, waiting for contributors...

I didn't have much time to set the things up for testing, so to see a demo just point your webserver to the top level folder and access the "example.html" file...

Currently I'm using the this chrome extension as nice and pratical way to serve the content: https://github.com/kzahel/web-server-chrome
